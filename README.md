## BikeSharing Summary

A ride-share program like CitiBike is very popular in busy metro areas like New York City, and would be a great addition to a larger urban community where parking spaces may be scarce. From the data, we've learned most rides are short, lasting less than one hour.  Peak riding hours are during morning and evening commute times. Male subscribers are the main user base of the business model. The data also shws that female users are a much smaller segment of the customer base and more outreach and marketing should be done to them.

Additional analysis to consider:

* __*Why are customers using a ride share - for communtes, leisuer or just sporadically?*__  This insight would help the company determine how to better engage and convert customers to subscribers.

* __*Is there a link between gender and location?*__  This insight would help the company determine how to engage female customers.
